BPMN Evaluation Scripts

This folder contains the rule-based evaluation scripts for BPMN exercises.

Although the current implementations were originally developed for a specific course topic (Tema B2), the underlying logic is generic and can be applied to any BPMN modeling exercise.

Purpose

These scripts implement structured evaluation criteria for:

Technical modeling correctness (events, gateways, tasks, data objects, data stores)

Administrative or formal compliance aspects

Integration of multiple rubric dimensions

Scope

The rules defined here are not tied to a specific process model.
They represent reusable evaluation criteria that can be adapted to:

Different BPMN exercises

Different academic topics

Different process domains

If needed, only the canonical references or parameter configurations must be adjusted — the evaluation logic remains reusable.
