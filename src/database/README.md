# Database Evaluation Criteria

This folder contains Python scripts implementing rule-based evaluation
for Database assignments.

Although originally developed for Tema B, the logic is designed to be
adaptable to any database assignment with a defined canonical schema
and evaluation criteria.

## Scripts

- `CompararBD_contra_Canonico.py`  
  Compares student JSON schemas against the canonical schema.

- `CompararSQL_contra_Canonico.py`  
  Validates SQL queries against canonical requirements.

- `Genera_nueva_integracion_SQL.py`  
  Integrates database and SQL evaluation feedback.

## Purpose

These scripts formalize database evaluation criteria into explicit,
auditable, and reproducible rules.
