# Academic Evaluation Criteria – Python

## Overview
This project formalizes academic evaluation criteria into explicit, reproducible Python rules.

The goal is not to replace academic judgment, but to make implicit evaluation criteria explicit, auditable, and testable, separating:
- rules
- exceptions
- and human intervention

## Problem
Academic evaluation often relies on implicit criteria that:
- are difficult to communicate,
- are inconsistently applied,
- and are hard to audit or reproduce.

This project addresses that gap by translating evaluation logic into code.

## Approach
- Evaluation criteria are expressed as explicit Python rules.
- Rules are separated from data input and reporting logic.
- Edge cases and exceptions are documented and handled explicitly.
- Human review is preserved where automation is not appropriate.

## Scope
Included:
- Python scripts implementing evaluation criteria
- Examples of rule-based evaluation logic
- Documentation of assumptions and limitations

Not included:
- Real student data
- Automated grading decisions without human validation

## Why this matters
This type of formalization is applicable beyond academia, including:
- business rule engines
- decision support systems
- data quality validation
- auditability in analytics pipelines

## Status
Work in progress. Scripts and documentation will be incrementally added.
